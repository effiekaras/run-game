**What I want my project to do:**

For my final project I would like to create a generic running game in a Cinder application.
My game will replicate a simplified "No Internet" Dino game, where the user
is able to select a customizable shape and colored character to play as.
The objective in the game is to jump through the map as long as possible to accrue
the highest score until touching one of the obstacles, where they lose.
As the game goes on, it increases with difficulty, as the obstacles spawn more and 
with a higher velocity.

**Background knowledge and why I want to do this project:**
I believe that most people have a general idea of these types of games and how it works,
so I thought it would be a fun game to recreate. In general, 
I thought it would be fun to create a game because its the best way to experience
feedback and interact with your programs, and this game seemed like a good way to 
do that.

**Rough timeline:**

* Week 1: Create the customizable menu to select shape and color for the character. Create
  the layout window for the game engine.
* Week 2: Implement the rng obstacle system and movement abilities/jumping.
* Week 3: Implement dying/contact with the obstacle/game over.

**Extra "stretch goals":**

If I have time I would like to add collectibles that might change the games layout or 
add extra bonus points. 
I could also add a leaderboard and remember top scores.
