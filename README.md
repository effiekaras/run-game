# Overview
I have created a simple endless running game, where the user is able to customize
the character's shape and color. Throughout the game, the user provides movement input through
jumps in order to dodge oncoming obstacles, while gaining score points as they survive.
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible, and try to beat your own top score!
